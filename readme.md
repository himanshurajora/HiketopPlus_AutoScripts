# Automatic points generator for hike top plus

This is a simple script that generates points for hiking top plus by liking and following users automatically.
Those points can then be used to generate followers for your self.

It was made to be used with Blue Stacks 4, and screen resolution of 1920x1080.

AutoLike script likes automatically

AutoFollow script follows the users automatically

Combo script can be used to run both and consume our daily quota

***

I made the unfollowscript.py to unfollow the users after the points have been generated. That helps in restoring account potential.

Libraries used: Pyautogui for Automatic mouse handling, PIL for getting screen pixel colors, and time for waiting until process completes. Time may be a bit inaccurate, depending on your computer processing and internet connection.

Note: It may or may not work in future versions of Hiketop+ and BlueStacks
We learn how programmers can solve any problem they want, even if the targeted application does not have an api available. Cheating is the best way of learning
